In this repository, you will find some of my assignment materials and
(eventually) links to other repositories with other computer science
projects. 

The current contents of this repository are:

## Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit
This is an assignment based on the classic article of the same name.
In this assignment, you will use an old installation of UNIX to
explore the exciting world of virus authorship. There is also a link
to a preconfigured replit which you can use to get up and running
right away.

## SEMOS
Here you will find a collection of lab assignments that form a modular
operating system project. The operating system targets the RISC-V
architecture and so you will need to have the risc-v toolchain and
qemu installed to use these.

On a debian based system, the following command will take care of the
tool installation:

```
sudo apt-get install git build-essential gdb-multiarch qemu-system-misc qemu-system-x86 qemu-utils gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu binutils-riscv64-linux-gnu 
```
